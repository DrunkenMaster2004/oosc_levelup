Experts and faculty can also join project teams to provide leadership. They certainly can as part of their project listing. However, as projects are generally executed by teams, clients find it advantageous to first accept bids and then apply filtering criteria. All client projects on Trumio represent real-world problems that need to be addressed in the course of business. With active participation from clients and experts \u2013 students pick up both domain centric expertise and soft skills, first hand. Just like any internship, every project requires the signing of a contract between each team member and the client, with an NDA being optional. The contract covers IP ownership and confidentiality terms and can be customized to each client project. Each client listing and a resultant bid from a student team specify targeted timelines for a project to ease planning and manageability. However, there are no penalties for delays though clients have the right to terminate future milestones if they do not see sufficient progress. Want to know more? Schedule a LIVE demo now!
